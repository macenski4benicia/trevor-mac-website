## Infrastructure

Our nation's infrastructure is crippling and Benicia is feeling the effects of long term deferred maintenance. The following  are my thoughts on how to improve our community infrastructure funding.

### Water and Sewer Rates

It’s safe to say that I haven’t run into anyone in town that is satisfied with our new water and sewer rates. It’s been proven that the roll out of such a fee structure was a complete blunder under the existing City leadership. Unfortunately, the largest part of most peoples’ bill, which didn’t get much airtime, was the service/maintenance charges on our bill. These fees consists of payments for pensions owed to current and former utility workers; as such, based on contracts negotiated with city unions years ago. This leaves the City with limited options to cover these pension liabilities, which we are currently covering with the service fees. Shifting such fees from our individual utility bills to the General Fund would lower utility bills, but would require decreasing city services in some other capacity. In light of the COVID-19 crises our existing city council voted on a freeze of programmed water and sewer rate increases until 2021. It was approved with every council-member supporting the motion, with the exception of the Mayor. If you interested in learning more about the history of the City's water and sewer rate structure, [click here for more information](https://www.ci.benicia.ca.us/watersewerrates). By focusing on economic expansion and tax generation we should be able to offset this cost from each individual resident and replace it with sales tax revenues.

### Roads

It’s no secret that our local city streets are crumbling. The existing City council has tried to tackle this problem as best as they can. With a system wide deterioration of our roadway network, we need to get creative on how to leverage state and federal dollars. The Federal Highway Administration has [several programs](https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/local_rural/training/fhwasa14087/local_funding.pdf) that we can explore to help fund paving our community streets. Also there are [alternative funding mechanisms](https://www.ci.benicia.ca.us/index.asp?SEC=350665EA-B577-4617-A9E1-129D097B135A&DE=6BCE2C50-1346-4BCB-A661-0F736B1A1E7D), like establishing benefit improvement districts in our downtown and industrial park, to target improvement areas so more general fund revenues can be reallocated to local community streets.
