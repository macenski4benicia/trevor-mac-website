## Open Government

A well functioning government is one that is transparent, accessible and open. Our residents must have access to their elected officials and their City Hall. They must be included and consulted in all city planning and decisions. I have worked hard to try and spread the word of social engagement in our civic matter to help stimulate interest in our many boards and commissions. Benicia does pretty well in this respect - but we can still do more.

Currently we televise most community commission and board meetings. This provides a convenient, additional way for our community to be informed and aware of city operations and the work efforts of individual commissions. But we can do better. As a Councilmember I will push for our community leaders to take another step toward more open government and arrange to establish a City YouTube channel (here is a sample for the [City of Vacaville](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLC4Gd7Z4rwlWOciZVhlJJw)) and use of streaming channels like on Facebook, of our civic meetings (here is a sample of [Los Altos](https://www.facebook.com/pg/CityOfLosAltos/videos/?ref=page_internal)) on how embracing such technology can help information become more easily accessible by our community members.This level of flexibility, allows community members, the ability to engage with civic discourse on their schedule. This will open another window and create more transparency about the day to day work going on at City Hall - and this can only serve to benefit our community.
