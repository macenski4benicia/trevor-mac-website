## Arts and Culture

As stated from PolicyLink in their [report for Creating Change Through Arts, Culture, and Equitable Development](https://www.policylink.org/sites/default/files/report_arts_culture_equitable-development.pdf), *"arts and culture are essential for building community, supporting development, nurturing health and well-being, and contributing to economic opportunity. Collectively, arts and culture enable understanding of Benicia’s past and envisioning of our future."*

In Benicia, our [Arts and Culture Commission](https://www.ci.benicia.ca.us/?SEC=D72021F0-6EFD-4EFD-8313-43C5EB17C3EE) acts as a catalyst for community engagement, shaping our public spaces, infrastructure, transportation, and other core amenities. Art helps develop a culture of creative minds that contribute to strengthening Benicians vision for the community. Knowing the great value the Arts can bring to a community, during my time on the Historic Preservation and Design Review Commission, I crafted a Condition of Approval requiring the Raley’s facade improvement project, which has yet to be constructed, to incorporate a public art installation into its store frontage. As a city council member, I will strongly advocate for the arts and make sure our community identity is expressed through our local artisans.
