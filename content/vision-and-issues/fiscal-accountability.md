## Fiscal Accountability

Fiscal accountability is essential to our community's success. To become an economically solvent city we must become more fiscally accountable in order to maintain our quality of life and all of the services we have come to enjoy in Benicia. Our overall declining financial condition is the result of several factors - lack of solid budgetary practices, implementing reasonable cost control measures, and poor oversight and efficiency. We must continue to streamline city processes and reduce costs. And, of course, our focus must stay on long-term, sustainable financial planning so that we are always able to maintain the high level of city services our residents, businesses, and patrons have come to expect from Benicia.
