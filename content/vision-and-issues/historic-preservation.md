## Historic Preservation

When I was first interviewed by our hiring panel for the Historic Preservation and Design Review Commission, they asked me why I want to serve on the HPRC. My response was simple. You know that feeling you get when you're walking down first street? It’s hard to explain, but you know you are in a place special. That’s because as a community we have balanced the need for economic expansion and historic preservation. We have carefully held on to the character of our community, while still providing some expansion and renovation. Having sat on the HPRC and the committee for the [Downtown Historic District Design Guidelines](https://www.ci.benicia.ca.us/downtowndesign), I helped balance the interest of our local architects, engineers, and designers with our passionate preservation and art communities.
