  <h2>Trevor for City Council</h2>
  <p>Benicia is a family residential community with a historic identity - with several important, smaller commercial areas and major regional economic business interests in our Industrial Park. My goals for our city are straightforward - protect our quality of life and support our local businesses to ensure our town’s stability and security. As a Environmental Planner and collegiate educator, I have had the opportunity to help hundreds of communities in California. In doing so I have developed first hand knowledge in building consensus among diverse interest groups, solving complex problems facing Californians from homelessness, affordable housing, water conservation, energy conservation, economic diversity, and environmental preservation. It’s because of this diverse background and work ethic that our community has entrusted me with guiding the future of our community on the Planning Commission. As a council member, I’ll strive to improve the city’s Strategic Planning, Open Government, Financial Accountability, Safety and Security, Business Collaboration and Education.
