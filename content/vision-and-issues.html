      We will champion the expansion of commercial and retail centers to generate new tax dollars, fueling Benicia's economic growth while preserving our community’s unique heritage. Our plan includes developing new housing options that meet the needs of Benicia’s future, from affordable, family-centered housing for the missing middle to senior housing that allows longtime community members to age in place. We will continue to help streamline development hurdles and improve processes to create a Benicia where progress and preservation coexist in harmony.
